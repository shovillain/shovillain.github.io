            <h2 class="featurette-heading"><b>Robin</b>
                <span class="text-muted">"Robin is the perfectionist leader of the group, whose main complaint is that the other Titans won't do what he says."</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Robin enjoys being the team leader and is willing to do anything to ensure his position remains the same, as shown in Money Grandma, where he runs a smear campaign against the others to ensure he is voted leader again. He can be very overbearing, and is often too obsessed over his work. He is easily angered if the other Titans ignore or even question his orders. However, he can still be fun-loving and silly at times, although he is not very funny and tells terrible jokes. He is also self-appointed</p>

                <span class="text-muted">"Cyborg is a laid-back, half-teen, half-robot who's more interested in pizza and video games than in fighting crime.".</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cyborg is shown to be very lazy, contrary to the original animated series where he engineered the main vehicles for the Titans and programmed the security alarms for the Tower. He loves to have fun and yell, and is very enthusiastic. When it comes to combat, he does not hesitate to get the job done. He considers his robotic self to be superior to humans.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"><b>Best Boy</b>
                <span class="text-muted">"Beast Boy is Cyborg's best bud - a slightly dim but lovable loafer who transforms into all sorts of animals when he's not eating burritos, watching TV or playing video games."</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Quick with his tongue but utterly insecure, Beast Boy will do anything for a laugh. Beast Boy is the playful trickster of the group. He enjoys pulling pranks on people, and he can't seem to tell when he's gone too far, as shown in "Ghost Boy". He also seems to be quite lazy, as shown in "Dude Relax". He tricks the other Titans into fighting while he just goes home and drinks soda until he is caught by Robin. In episodes such as "Hot Garbage", Beast Boy is shown to be messy, but sees it as beauty.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"><b>Starfire</b>
                <span class="text-muted">I am the cool...Shamma Lamma Mu-Mu!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Starfire is kind hearted, joyous, and optimistic, preferring to see the good in every situation to the opposite of apathetic Raven. Her sunny personality, politeness, and kindness is shared among both friends and even her enemies such as Jinx,[3] Doctor Light,[4] and the H.I.V.E. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"><b>Raven</b>
                <span class="text-muted">"Well, look at me. Who wants to be your friend when you're basically the spawn of an intergalactic demon?"</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">aven comes across as the equivalent to a goth with a dark, brooding and sarcastic personality. Unlike the other Titans, she doesn't display any extreme emotion when saddened, shocked, or happy preferring to either give a small smile, frown, or bulging eyes. Raven relaxes by meditating or reading a book and is angered when interrupted by the other Titans' antics.Despite her generally stoic attitude, she is shown to be short-tempered and quick to anger, revealing her inner demon whenever she is frustrated. During this period, her eyes glow red and she attacks and injures whomever was the cause of her anger or in her way.</p>
